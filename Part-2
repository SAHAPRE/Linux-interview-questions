What is swap and when is it used? ---
Swap memory is a dedicated area on disk (or SSD) that the Linux operating system uses as virtual memory when the system‚Äôs physical RAM is full.
A backup memory that the system can fall back on when RAM runs out.

üîß When Is Swap Used?
Swap is used only when RAM is full. Here‚Äôs how it typically works:
RAM is filled up by running applications.
Linux identifies less-used memory pages.
Those memory pages are moved to swap space (disk).
This frees up physical RAM for active processes.

üß™ Example Scenario
Suppose your system has:

4 GB RAM and 2 GB Swap then If applications use 4.5 GB of memory: - 4 GB is stored in RAM then 0.5 GB spills over into Swap

üìâ Downsides of Swap
Much slower than RAM (disk I/O latency)
Can lead to system lag or thrashing if heavily used
Should not be used as a permanent substitute for RAM

How can I see all processes that are running? How about which ones are taking up the most CPU/Memory?
ps -ef(shows less option) - best is top and ps aux

How do you restart a service?
sudo systemctl restart nginx
sudo systemctl restart ssh

How do you see what IP address is assigned to the box?
| Command                | Use Case                          |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `ip a`                 | Full IP and interface details     |

What is /etc/fstab used for?
The /etc/fstab file (short for File System Table) is a configuration file that tells the system how and where to mount storage devices (like disks, partitions, USB drives,
network shares) at boot time. mount -a will be used.
Automatically mounts filesystems and partitions during system startup.
Defines mount points, mount options, and file system types.

How do you format a partition/drive?
Formatting a drive or partition means creating a filesystem (like ext4, xfs, vfat) on it, making it ready to store data.
| Task                  | Command                           |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| List disks/partitions | `lsblk` or `sudo fdisk -l`        |
| Format to ext4        | `sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdX1`        |
| Format to xfs         | `sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/sdX1`         |
| Format to vfat (USB)  | `sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sdX1`        |
| Mount a disk          | `sudo mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt/point` |
| Make it auto-mount    | Add entry to `/etc/fstab`         |

What is /root used for?
The /root directory is the home directory of the root user, who is the superuser or administrator on a Linux system.
| Directory | Purpose                     | Owner  | Access             |
| --------- | --------------------------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| `/root`   | Home directory of root user | `root` | Only root (secure) |
| `/home/`  | Home dirs for regular users | Varies | Per-user access    |
| Feature                 | Description                                                             |

| Path                    | Always located at `/root` (unlike normal users who live under `/home/`) |
| Permissions             | Only accessible by `root` (owner: `root`, permissions: `700`)           |
| Typical Usage           | Root's scripts, configuration files, backups, or temporary system tasks |
